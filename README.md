# DPNS - A Push Notification Server

Simple REST API documented with examples in [DPNS.http](https://github.com/danieldesira/DPNS/blob/master/DPNS/DPNS.http).
The [_REST Client_ VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) is recommended.

However, _Visual Studio 2026_ is recommended to work with the codebase.

In order to create the database, run the migration as follows:
`dotnet ef database update InitialCreate`
